# Introduction to ASP.NET Core 1.0
### _KEA CS 4th Semester 24-11-2016_

## Agenda today
The porpouse of today is to introduce you to ASP.NET Core 1.0. 

We will start out by doing a low level introduction to how .NET Core, and ASP.NET Core works. 
This will include installing .NET Core on Windows, Mac or Linux, creating a first hello world console application, and 
creating a basic asp.net web application. We will also install and start using the VS Code editor.


In connection with deployment we will shortly touch the use of a Docker Image as the platform for our deployed ASP.NET Core Application.

## Installation of .net core
